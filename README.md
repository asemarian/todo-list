# Todo List

A todo list app created with React. I also used React Transition Group to add some simple animations, and localStorage to save all the tasks locally. The app is responsive as well, but more work could be done there. You can add, edit, or delete tasks as you please. The length of each task is limited to 50 characters. Give it a try here: https://asemarian.github.io/todo-list/

## Install

Download/clone, cd into the directory, run `npm install`, then run `npm start`.
